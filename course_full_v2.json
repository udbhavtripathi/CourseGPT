            "content_output": "1. Introduction to Python Web Frameworks:\n\n- Python web frameworks are libraries or modules that provide a structure and set of tools to simplify the development of web applications using Python programming language.\n   Example: Flask, Django, Pyramid, Bottle, Tornado.\n\n- These frameworks help developers focus on writing the application logic rather than dealing with low-level details of handling web requests, routing, and database interactions.\n\n- Python web frameworks follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, which separates the application logic, data storage, and user interface components.\n\n- Most popular Python frameworks, such as Flask and Django, provide features like URL routing, request handling, template rendering, and accessing databases.\n\n- Flask is a micro-framework that is easy to get started with and allows developers to have more control over the components they use. It is suitable for small to medium-sized applications.\n   Example: \n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, render_template\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   @app.route('/')\n   def hello_world():\n       return 'Hello, World!'\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       app.run()\n   ```\n\n- Django is a high-level framework that includes many built-in features, such as an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), user authentication, and an admin interface. It is well-suited for larger applications with complex requirements.\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   from django.urls import path\n   from .views import hello_world\n\n   urlpatterns = [\n       path('', hello_world, name='home'),\n   ]\n   ```\n\n- Python web frameworks support various templating engines (e.g., Jinja2, Django templates) that allow embedding dynamic content within HTML templates.\n   Example (using Jinja2 syntax):\n   ```html\n   <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>\n   ```\n\n- Python web frameworks provide database integration with commonly used databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. They offer tools for database migrations, data modeling, and querying.\n   Example (using Django's ORM):\n   ```python\n   from django.db import models\n\n   class User(models.Model):\n       name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n       email = models.EmailField()\n\n       def __str__(self):\n           return self.name\n   ```\n\n- Some Python web frameworks also support RESTful API development and provide features like serialization, authentication, and request/response handling for building web services.\n   Example (using Flask-RESTful extension):\n   ```python\n   from flask_restful import Resource, Api\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n   api = Api(app)\n\n   class HelloWorld(Resource):\n       def get(self):\n           return {'message': 'Hello, World!'}\n\n   api.add_resource(HelloWorld, '/')\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       app.run()\n   ```\n\n- Python web frameworks have a vast community and extensive documentation, making it easy for beginners to find resources and get help.\n\n- Choosing the right Python web framework depends on the project requirements, complexity, scalability needs, and personal preference."
